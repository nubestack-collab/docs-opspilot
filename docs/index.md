# OpsPilot

**AI on your terminal — including the terminals AI can't normally reach.**

OpsPilot is a desktop operations workbench — a terminal, a file manager, a
remote-desktop client and an AI assistant in one application. You connect the way
you always have — SSH, RDP, VNC, FTP, S3, serial, or a local shell — and OpsPilot
watches the session with you. Ask it a question and it reads the scrollback,
strips the secrets out locally, and brings back an explanation plus a proposed
command.

!!! quote ""
    **The AI helps you operate your infrastructure. It never operates your
    infrastructure itself.**

That command does not run on its own. It appears in front of you, labelled with a
risk tier and showing the exact text you are about to execute. You decide.

## What makes it different

Most AI tooling assumes the machine you are working on can reach the internet,
and assumes that giving the model a shell is the point. OpsPilot assumes the
opposite on both counts.

Your servers can stay disconnected: only the workstation needs to reach the AI,
and with a local model not even that. And the model is never given a shell — it
can propose, it cannot execute. Together those two properties make OpsPilot
usable in estates where AI assistance has not been an option: regulated banking,
defence, healthcare, industrial control, classified networks, and production
environments where a model running a command directly would not pass review.

Nothing is installed on the target hosts — no agent, no sidecar, no daemon and no
outbound firewall rule. Any host you can already reach is a host OpsPilot can
work against.

!!! note "Private or VPN-only is not the same as air-gapped"
    With a cloud provider, your *workstation* still talks to the internet — that
    is private or VPN-only operation, and it is what most regulated teams
    actually need. For a genuinely air-gapped deployment, point OpsPilot at a
    local Ollama or self-hosted model and the loop closes entirely: nothing
    leaves the machine.

## The safety model

- **The AI never gets a shell.** Proposals become commands only when you approve
  them. This is architectural, not a setting.
- **Secrets are removed locally, before anything leaves the machine.** Every
  route to a model redacts first.
- **Your pattern list can only make things stricter.** A pattern can promote a
  command to <span class="tier tier-high">High risk</span>; nothing can demote
  one the model already flagged.
