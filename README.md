# docs-opspilot

Product documentation for **NubeStack OpsPilot** — an AI operations workbench for
DevOps, SRE, network, platform and development teams.

This repository contains documentation only. The product itself lives in a
separate repository.

Published site: <https://opspilot.nubestack.com/> (GitHub Pages default: <https://nubestack-collab.github.io/docs-opspilot/>)

## Build it locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

mkdocs serve           # live preview on http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build --strict   # what CI runs; must pass before you push
```

`--strict` fails the build on a broken internal link or a page missing from the
nav. Keep it strict — a silently dead link in product documentation is worse
than a red build.

## Before you write a page

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

`CLAUDE.md` holds the facts: which product source file is authoritative for
which claim, the ten product invariants a page must never contradict, a table of
known inaccuracies in the upstream user guide, and the honesty rules this site
is written under.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` holds the craft: voice, page shape, the terminology table, how
to reference images and risk-tier badges, and the checklist a change has to pass.

The short version: the product source code is the authority, the user guide is
the narrative starting point, limitations get documented rather than marketed
around, and nothing gets invented — no prices, paths, flags, shortcuts or URLs
that are not in a source.

## Publishing

Pushes to `main` build and deploy to GitHub Pages automatically; pull requests
stop at the strict build and publish nothing.

No manual setup is needed. The deploy job runs `actions/configure-pages` with
`enablement: true`, which switches Pages on for the repository and sets the
source to **GitHub Actions** on the first run. If the very first run fails on
that step, the repository's Actions permissions are read-only — set **Settings →
Actions → General → Workflow permissions** to allow write access, or turn Pages
on by hand under **Settings → Pages** with **GitHub Actions** as the source, then
re-run the workflow.

## Custom domain

The site is served at `opspilot.nubestack.com` rather than the default
`nubestack-collab.github.io` address. Two things make that work, both already in
place:

- `docs/CNAME` — a single line, `opspilot.nubestack.com`. MkDocs copies it into
  `site/` on every build, and GitHub Pages reads it from the deployed artifact to
  know which custom domain to serve.
- `site_url` in `mkdocs.yml` — set to `https://opspilot.nubestack.com/`, which
  drives the canonical `<link>` tag and the sitemap.

Two things outside this repository have to match, and only an org admin can set
them:

1. **DNS** — at whichever provider hosts the actual nameservers for
   `nubestack.com` (check the registrar's DNS/nameserver settings if unsure — a
   domain bought at Namecheap is not necessarily hosted there), a `CNAME` record
   for the `opspilot` host pointing at `nubestack-collab.github.io`.
2. **GitHub** — the repository's **Settings → Pages → Custom domain** field set
   to `opspilot.nubestack.com`, and **Enforce HTTPS** ticked once GitHub has
   issued a certificate for it. The organisation may also need to verify the
   domain under its own **Settings → Pages → Verified domains** first, if
   GitHub asks for that before it will accept the custom domain.

If the domain is ever retired, delete `docs/CNAME`, revert `site_url` to the
`github.io` address, and clear the custom domain in repository settings — a
stale `CNAME` file left behind is the most common way a Pages site gets stuck
on a domain it no longer controls.
